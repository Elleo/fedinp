# Fedi Now Playing

This is a really quickly hacked together project to display now playing information from [Radio Free Fedi](https://radiofreefedi.net/) on an RGB matrix display.

## Installation

Setup your RGB matrix based on the instructions here: https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix

Install the requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.text`

Then just run `./fedinp.py`
